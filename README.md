# ValoFix
An powershell script that fixes valorant errors, checks secure boot, if not open, it attempts to open it, if fails, it asks you to open it manually, if secure boot is open and its still giving an error, the program automatically reinstalls valorant.  If it still give's an error, you should update your BIOS or reset your device.
